# Driver and Utility file example

This example shows how you can mount a utility notebook to your "driver" file and run functions from the utilities in the driver file. 

**NOTE:** The name of the utilities notebook that you are looking to import _has_ to have the extension `.ipynb` so that the `import_ipynb` package works correctly.
